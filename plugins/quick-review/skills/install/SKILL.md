# Install skill

## Option 1: Installing something in npm / uv / and so on

Use the command line (e.g `npm install`), don't change the package file directly (e.g `package.json`)

## Option 2: Installing new software on the computer

Check what are the recent installation instructions for this software, e.g `https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/` to check how to install `uv`, from the OFFICIAL website not a blog post or so.

Don't default to `brew` or to installation instructions you memorized, but rather check what is the latest recommended way to install.

## Option 3: Installing python versions specifically

Use `pyenv` by default. [Here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) are the installation instructions if it's not installed.
